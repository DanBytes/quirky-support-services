            <h2>About Us</h2>
        
            <p>
                At Quirky Support Services we have a team of dedicated, 
                trained staff who absolutely love making a positive 
                impact towards the people we support. Our team is 
                diverse in a sense of their extensive experience, skills 
                and unique Quirky personalities. They all have one thing 
                in common though, that is a passion and drive for 
                supporting and inspiring people to live the life they 
                choose.
